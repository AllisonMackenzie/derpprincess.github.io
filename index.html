      <p class="center">
        I started my journey as a Software Engineer in 2014 by enrolling in the Computer Science program at the University of Pikeville.
      </p>
      <p class="center">It was there that I learned the fundamentals of Software Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.</p>
      <p class="center">I was primarily exposed to Java, with some basic introductory to Python, Swift, Racket, Prolog, and C.</p>
      <p class="center">At university, I worked as an Academic Tutor teaching Computer Science and English in 2017 before embarking on my study abroad to Nagoya, Japan where I attended <a href="https://www-e.nufs.ac.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NUFS</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">I made some of my own side projects and worked on some great open source projects like <a href="https://openmrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenMRS</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">May 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
      <p class="center">Since then, I expanded my skills to include C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>
      <p class="center">Because of the COVID Pandemic, I spent the better portion of 2020 improving my skills and learning new ones such as Web Development with React.</p>
      <p class="center">I started freelancing in 2020, making websites for people using technology such as React and WordPress. Some websites I've made are even <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Full Stack MERN Apps</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">This is my portfolio.</p>

      <h2 class="center">Web Developer</h2>
      <h3 class="center">JavaScript | TypeScript | MongoDB | Express | React | Node | HTML & CSS</h3>
      <div class="center"><img src="/images/reactlogo.png" alt="Web Dev Pic" width="10%"/></div>
      <p class="center">My work related to Web Development has ranged from simple WordPress websites to Full Stack MERN Apps.</p>
      <p class="center">I got started with React in 2019. Needless to say, it has been a mountain. During the 2020 half of the COVID pandemic, I solidified my skills and started making things for others. Small in scale, it's my hope that the foundation I received by freelancing will help lead to large scale projects in the future.</p>
      <p class="center">It feels limited to me to only work in the front end or only in the back end, so Full Stack development made the most sense and due to its popularity I decided to learn the MERN Stack.</p>
