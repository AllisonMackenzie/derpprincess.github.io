      <p class="center">
        I started my journey as a Software Engineer in 2014 by enrolling in the Computer Science program at the University of Pikeville.
      </p>
      <p class="center">It was there that I learned the fundamentals of Software Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.</p>
      <p class="center">I was primarily exposed to Java, with some basic introductory to Python, Swift, Racket, Prolog, and C.</p>
      <p class="center">At university, I worked as an Academic Tutor teaching Computer Science and English in 2017 before embarking on my study abroad to Nagoya, Japan where I attended <a href="https://www-e.nufs.ac.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NUFS</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">I made some of my own side projects and worked on some great open source projects like <a href="https://openmrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenMRS</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">May 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
      <p class="center">Since then, I expanded my skills to include C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>
      <p class="center">Because of the COVID Pandemic, I spent the better portion of 2020 improving my skills and learning new ones such as Web Development with React.</p>
      <p class="center">I started freelancing in 2020, making websites for people using technology such as React and WordPress. Some websites I've made are even <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Full Stack MERN Apps</a>!</p>
      <p class="center">This is my portfolio.</p>

      <div class="center"><img src="/images/StarLight.png" alt="Software Dev Pic" /></div>
      <p class="center">My work related to Software Development has involved building a Graphics2D Java Game Engine prototype to working on OpenMRS, a collaborative open-source project to develop software to support the delivery of health care in developing countries, and more. I've also built Lua Scripts for pulling information from games to display on screen and even programmed my own NodeJS Discord Bot!</p>

      <p class="center">My work related to Web Development has ranged from simple WordPress websites to Full Stack MERN Apps.</p>
      <p class="center">I got started with React in 2019. Needless to say, it has been a mountain. During the 2020 half of the COVID pandemic, I solidified my skills and started making things for others. Small in scale, it's my hope that the foundation I received by freelancing will help lead to large scale projects in the future.</p>
      <p class="center">It feels limited to me to only work in the front end or only in the back end, so Full Stack development made the most sense and due to its popularity I decided to learn the MERN Stack.</p>

      <h3 class="center">Unity & C# | Unreal Engine & C++</h3>
      <div class="center"><img src="/images/GameDev.png" alt="Game Dev Pic" /></div>
      <p class="center">My work related to Game Development has ranged from making simple games in RPG maker as a kid to making small demos as an adult with professional tools such as Unity and Unreal Engine. It is my hope in the future that I continue learning and explore more ideas and keep improving what I make. It's been a goal of mine since I was a kid actually to be a Game Developer and perhaps one day I hope to explore that venture in the future.</p>
