        are cat people, popularize by Japanese anime. I really wanted to make a
        bot that would be for silly activities instead of something serious.
        Regardless, it has the full power of the

        The bot can do things like interact with users by responding to their

        This Bot is something I hope to continuously upgrade with more features

        StarLight was something I made while still in university to understand
        how building a 2D Game Engine from the ground up would be. Needless to
        say, it was very difficult.
      </p>
      <p class="center">
        The rendering engine primarily uses

          >Graphics2D</a
        >. The core logic is handled on a tick based system, similar to those
        found in

      </p>
      <p class="center">
        The Engine comes with a prototype example already and although the
        prototype is basic, it shows proof of concepts of an engine that is
        complex it nature, not to the complexity of things like Unreal Engine of
        course but the amount of math that goes on was not something I was
        expecting going into making this.
      </p>
      <p class="center">
        The Engine works by reading map files based on color hex coordinates
        that one could make in any art program and that coordinate runs through
        the engines logic to place blocks, monsters, people, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="center">
        One aspect of the engine I wanted was the ability for easily adding
        variable health display options, as can be seen here this is the
        "Hearts" option, similar to what you would see in

        TAS Display is my codename for the various Lua contributions I'm making
        to help make creating these types of video game movies easier.
        Essentially, it's wrapped inside of an executable that provide a lua
        file to be ran based on the game you're playing, if one exists inside
        the wrapper. I'm not sure of the extent to which I will be adding games
        to the list, but it currently supports over 10 games!
